# Symmetrical Journey

This name was provided by GitHub.
It has nothing to do with my mod, or maybe it does.

This mod makes getting food unnecessarily complicated.

It will *not* add new Items, Blocks, Biomes, etc.
It will only change or add new behaviour to vanilla features.

# Roadmap

- [x] Cows, Pigs, Sheep, Rabbits, etc. drop meat if and only if killed with an anvil.
- [x] Cows fight back when attacked (needs optimization).
- [x] Pigs fight back when attacked (needs optimization).
- [x] Rabbits go into sonic mode if attacked (needs optimization/balancing).
- [x] Sheep die when attacked (vanilla behaviour) .
- [x] Wheat, Potatoes, Carrots, etc. all grow significantly slower.
- [x] Wheat, Potatoes, Carrots, etc. only drop items when they're fully mature.
- [x] Wheat, Potatoes, and Carrots get eaten by parrots.
- [x] Parrots fear Carved Pumpkins and won't eat Wheat, Potatoes, and Carrots if nearby.
- [x] Parrots fear Iron Golems and won't eat Wheat, Potatoes, and Carrots if nearby.
- [x] Parrots fear Snow Golems and won't eat Wheat, Potatoes, and Carrots if nearby.
- [x] Parrots fear players with Carved Pumpkins as Head and won't eat Wheat, Potatoes, and Carrots if nearby (should work; not tested).
- [x] Fish only spawn if it is raining.
- [x] Fish only drop themselves when killed with an Fishing Rod.
- [x] Fishing Rods can be enchanted with Sharpness (using either a Book or an Enchanting Table).
- [x] Furnaces, Smokers, etc. are dangerous if used to cook food.
- [ ] Somehow deal with Villager trades.
- [x] Somehow deal with fishing (probably not done).
- [x] The Fishing Rod line now has a 3% chance to break after being used (meaning its line "breaks").
- [x] The Fishing Rod line can be repaired using a string on the Fletching Table.
- [x] Mooshrooms now attack when being milked for their stew.
- [ ] Somehow reward better food (stews, golden carrots, etc).
